#### Why You Need An Improved WordPress Search ####

The default WordPress search often falls short of user expectations. By combining all search results onto one page it can be difficult to find what you need, whether it is products or blog posts.

SuperSearch addresses these limitations by allowing users to tailor their search based on content type, streamlining the search process without and eliminating the need to navigate away from the page.

You can effortlessly enhance your website’s search functionality by adding SuperSearch anywhere on your site using a simple shortcode. Experience the power of SuperSearch without the hassle – install it swiftly and effortlessly, and watch your search capabilities transform instantly!


#### See search results fast ####

**Here’s how we make it happen:**
When you install the plugin, you syncronise your site data to our SuperSearch platform. We process this data to what we call a search index, which is data optimized for searching. You can manually update the search index when you choose from the plugin, or once a day the plugin will automatically send updates to the search index when a page, post or product have been created or updated.

Our search index is a streamlined extract of your site data converted into structure that provides fast data lookup, significantly enhancing the speed of search results. We further process this data by implementing additional index optimization to improve the search results that handle typos and relavance of the results. The outcome? Lightning-fast context and relavant search results that transform the user experience, making finding information on your site quick, efficient, and incredibly responsive.

The WordPress plugin is released under the GPLv3 license, which does NOT extend to any associated Hi-Orbit services.
